Welcome to my site! I am currently a CS master's student at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>. My current study and research interests primarily lie in the field of visual generative modeling.

Prior to Brown, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.monash.edu/">Monash University</a> 
and received my (first class) Honours degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/">The University of Sydney</a>.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games 🎮, watching movies 🎥, and playing sports like badminton 🏸, table tennis 🏓, and so on. I'm also deeply interested in AI business and have often thought about launching an AI startup.

  <p class="highlight-title">💡 I am actively looking for research collaborations in the field of image/video generation. Feel free to drop me an email if interested, or just to say hi! 👋</p>
