### General Idea

Basically the idea is to iteratively count the specific "number of orders" based on the number of 
possible sequences for "number of orders - 1"; and the number of possibilities of placing Pickup 
and Delivery in each previous sequence, which can be calculated by summing up the first 
`((number of orders - 1) * 2 + 1)` natural numbers.

The formula might be a bit vague at the first glance, let's have a look at an example first:

Suppose we are dealing with 2 orders, and we have already known that for 1 order the answer is 1, 
which the only possible sequence is `(P1, D1)`. We want to insert `P2` and `D2` somewhere such that `D2` is 
always after `P2`, so let's think about where we can insert `P2` first.

We can insert P2 at any position in `(P1, D1)`, and all the possibilities are: `(P2, P1, D1)`, `(P1, P2, D1)` 
and `(P1, D1, P2)` with the indices being `[0, 1, 2]`, which the number of possibilities of placing P2 is 
exactly `k * 2 + 1`, where `k` represents the number of orders - 1, and `* 2` means each order has 2 states 
(Pickup and Delivery).

Why? You can think of it as we can insert `P2` right after any index, plus `P2` being the first before 
all the others, that doesn't violate the conditions since we haven't inserted/considered `D2` yet.

Now we can imagine where to put `D2` when `P2` is settled down, it can be anywhere as long as after `P2`, right? 
So when `P2` is at index 0, there can be 3 possibilities `D2` can be placed, right after `P2` at index `1 - 
[P2, D2, P1, D1]`, or after `P1 - [P2, P1, D2, D1]`, or after `D1 - [P2, P1, D1, D2]`. And when `P2` is at index 1, 
there can be 2 possibilities (`D2` right after `P2 - [P1, P2, D2, D1]`, or at `the last index - [P1, P2, D1, D2]`). 
And lastly when `P2` is at index 2, the only possibility is `[P1, D1, P2, D2]`. Therefore, `1 * (3 + 2 + 1) = 6` in 
total, being the answer for 2 orders.

From the above example, we can observe the pattern: When Pickup is at index say `x`, The number of possibilities 
Delivery of the same number of orders can be placed is of `(k * 2 + 1) - x`, which means anywhere after `x` 
(inclusively, meaning right after Pickup). Since `x` can be anything in `[0 .. k * 2]`, therefore the number of 
possibilities to place Pickup and Delivery, given a sequence of `k` (i.e., `number of orders - 1`), is calculated 
by `((k * 2 + 1) - 0, (k * 2 + 1) - 1, ... (k * 2 + 1) - k * 2)`. That is, for example for 3 orders, which 3 - 1 
orders that has 4 states - (P1, D1, P2 and D2), the number of possibilities based on a given previous sequence 
is 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15, that is the sum of the first `(k * 2 + 1)` natural numbers! And since there are 6 
possible sequences for the previous number of orders (= 2), therefore for 3 orders, the answer is 6 * 15 = 90.

Overall, the answer for n orders, equals to:
> (The number of possible sequences for n - 1) * (The sum of the first n natural numbers)

### Code 

```python
class Solution:
    def countOrders(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        The sum of the first n natural numbers: (n + 1) * n / 2.
        e.g. For 10: (1 + 10) + (2 + 9) + (3 + 8) + ..., in total
        that has n / 2 sets such that each set equals to n + 1.
        """
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            """
            Here i - 1 represents the previous number of orders, (* 2) represents each has 2 states Pickup and Delivery,
            that together gives the total number of elements in each of it's possible sequences. Then + 1
            represents other than placing the Pickup at the end of each element, it can be placed at the first index 
            before everyone else. Together as ((i - 1) * 2 + 1) represents the number of possible places to put the Pickup
            and hence the natural number we need.
            """
            ans = math.floor((ans * ((((i - 1) * 2 + 1) + 1) * ((i - 1) * 2 + 1) / 2)) % (10 ** 9 + 7))
        
        return ans
