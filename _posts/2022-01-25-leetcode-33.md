### General Idea
Basically on top of binary search, we make use of the first item in the list, 
which gives information about whether the smallest is on the left or right side of the current chosen [mid], 
and handle each case by case. To clarify: If no rotate is made, the algorithm just works as usual.

Explanation at each step within the code below.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            
            if target < nums[mid]:
                if nums[mid] < nums[left]:
                    """
                    Smallest on the left side inclusively,
                    so if target is less than, it is only
                    possible on the left.
                    """

                else:
                    """
                    If the smallest is on the right side of mid
                    caused by a possible rotate.

                        nums[left] < target < nums[mid], 
                        since smallest on the right side, 
                        it's a perfect interval (non-decreasing).

                        Target possibly on the second half of 
                        the right part.
